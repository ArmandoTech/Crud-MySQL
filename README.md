# Crud-MySQL

This is a CRUD using Nodejs-express, MySQL to store all the data, ejs to make simple templates
and bootstrap to give it styles.

The database folder has the main command to create it using commands, but for the project
it was created by phpMyAdmin interface.

It is necessary to turn on MySQL and Apache on xampp to make it work properly.
